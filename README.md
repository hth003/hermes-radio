The Hermes Radio is a proximity alert that is integrated into a construction workerâ€™s two-way radio. The radio allows workers to:  Set and remove locations of hazards on the work site.  Be visually and audibly warned when they come within proximity of dangerous locations.  Aggregate a database of hazards on the worksite that can be seen in real-time by the foreman.
